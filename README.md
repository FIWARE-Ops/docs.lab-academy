[FIWARE Lab](https://www.fiware.org/developers/fiware-lab/) is the non-commercial sandbox environment of the [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org) Community. It offers, for free, the capability to innovate and experiment with the [FIWARE Technologies](https://www.fiware.org). Entrepreneurs and individuals can test FIWARE technologies as well as their applications within the FIWARE Lab, with the possibility to exploit Open Data published by cities and other organizations.

FIWARE Lab is deployed over a geographically distributed network of federated FIWARE Lab nodes. Each FIWARE Lab node maps to one, or a network of, data-centers on top of which an OpenStack instance has been deployed, federated and configured as a FIWARE Lab node (Cloud region) operated by a specific organization.

FIWARE Lab nodes provide more than just cloud resources. They are part of local FIWARE Ecosystems and FIWARE iHubs supporting and promoting access to the [FIWARE technology](https://www.fiware.org).
